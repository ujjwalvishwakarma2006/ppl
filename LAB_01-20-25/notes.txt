In Prolog, the underscore (_) is a special variable called the anonymous variable. It is used when you want to represent a variable but do not care about its value. Prolog will not attempt to unify or bind the anonymous variable to anything, and every occurrence of _ is treated as a unique variable

Key Features of _ (Anonymous Variable):
Doesn't Retain Values:
The value of _ is ignored, and it is treated as a fresh variable every time it appears.

Used to Ignore Values:
When you don't care about certain values in a rule or query, you can use _ to ignore them.

No Need for Naming:
Unlike regular variables (like X, Y), the anonymous variable does not need a name.





Understanding the `|` Symbol in Prolog
======================================

The `|` symbol in Prolog is used with lists and is called the **list constructor**
or **head-tail separator**. It allows you to split a list into its first element
(the head) and the remaining elements (the tail).

General Syntax:
---------------
    [Head | Tail]

    - `Head`: Represents the first element of the list.
    - `Tail`: Represents the rest of the list (a list itself).

How it Works:
-------------
The `|` divides the list into its components. For example:

    [a, b, c] = [Head | Tail].

This unifies:
    - Head = a
    - Tail = [b, c]

Examples of Using `|`
----------------------

1. **Decomposing a List:**
   Extract the first element (head) and the rest of the list (tail):
   ```prolog
   decompose([Head | Tail]) :-
       write('Head: '), write(Head), nl,
       write('Tail: '), write(Tail).







'!' is known as the cut operator in prolog
var(x) checks if x is a varaible
