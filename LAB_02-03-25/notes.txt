Today we solve some puzzels in prolog

first is 'The Goat Problem'

A farmer has to cross a river with a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.
He has a boat, but in the boat he can take just one thing.
He cannot let the goat alone with the wolf or the goat with the cabbage. 
Itâ€™s obvious why. What is the solution?
We describe the problem as Nodes in a graph and the solution means to find a path from
the initial node to the final node.
state(s) = node is graph 
s(farmer(Bank),goat(Bank),cabbage(Bank),wolf(Bank)).
Bank can be East (e) or West (w).
